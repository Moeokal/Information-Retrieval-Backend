In numerical analysis, fixed-point iteration is a method of computing fixed points of a function.
More specifically, given a  function 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   defined on the real numbers with real values and given a point 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{0}}
   in the domain of 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
  , the fixed-point iteration is

  
    
      
        
          x
          
            n
            +
            1
          
        
        =
        f
        (
        
          x
          
            n
          
        
        )
        ,
        
        n
        =
        0
        ,
        1
        ,
        2
        ,
        …
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{n+1}=f(x_{n}),\,n=0,1,2,\dots }
  which gives rise to the sequence 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            0
          
        
        ,
        
          x
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        
          x
          
            2
          
        
        ,
        …
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{0},x_{1},x_{2},\dots }
   which is hoped to converge to a point 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  . If 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   is continuous, then one can prove that the obtained 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is a fixed point of 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
  , i.e.,

  
    
      
        f
        (
        x
        )
        =
        x
        .
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(x)=x.\,}
  More generally, the function 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   can be defined on any metric space with values in that same space.
