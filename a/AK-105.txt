The AK-105 is a shortened carbine version of the AK-74M rifle, which in turn was derived from the original AK-47 design and its successor, the AK-74. The AK-102, AK-104 and AK-105 are very similar in design, the only difference being the caliber and corresponding magazine type. The AK-105 is chambered to fire 5.45Ã—39mm ammunition.
