The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) is a Nigerian ministry that administers the Federal Capital Territory of Nigeria.
It is headed by a Minister appointed by the President, assisted by a Permanent Secretary, who is a career civil servant. 
The Federal Capital Territory Administration was created by President Olusegun Obasanjo on December 31, 2004 following the scrapping of the Ministry of the Federal Capital Territory (MFCT). Seven new Mandate Secretariats were created for Education, Transport, Agriculture and Rural Development, Health and Human Services, Social development, Legal Services and Area Council. These  Secretariats were headed by non-career civil servants in an attempt to reduce administrative bottlenecks.Several agencies are funded by the FCTA, including the Abuja Environmental Protection Board, concerned with waste collection and disposal and other environmental matters; the Abuja Geographical Information System, which provides a geo-spatial data infrastructure and a one stop for all land matters for the FCT, used to facilitate land acquisition and collect all land related revenue for the FCT; the Abuja Metropolitan Management Council (AMMC) for various municipal services; the Federal Capital Development Authority; and others.
