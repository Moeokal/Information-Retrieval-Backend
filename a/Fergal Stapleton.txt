Stapleton studied at Middlesex Polytechnic (now Middlesex University) and graduated from the MA Programme at Goldsmiths College, London in 1993.
Between 1994 and 1997 he collaborated on a number of works with Turner Prize nominee Rebecca Warren. He is represented by Carl Freedman Gallery.Stuart Morgan (art critic) on Stapleton's 1993 show "His manner of entertaining us…the worst thing I have ever done."
(frieze (magazine), No. 10, May 1993):  'The logic of dandyism as a mode of conceptual art assumes a view of the dandy not as engaged in a foppish, decadent pursuit but as an attempt to get over class distinction by creating one's own aristocracy, doing what aristocrats do but doing it better, secure in the knowledge that their order and the natural superiority it implies is on a false premise.’
Stapleton has been an occasional lecturer on the MA Fine Art programmes at Goldsmiths College, University of London, Birmingham Institute of Art & Design, Birmingham City University, and the Slade School of Fine Art.  He has also contributed to the art review section of TimeOut magazine (Nos. 1418 & 1421–1425).
Stapleton is additionally the author of a novel titled After the Death of the Goat God (Key Principles in History 2) ISBN 978-0956441928
