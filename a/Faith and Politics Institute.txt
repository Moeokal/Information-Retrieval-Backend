The Faith & Politics Institute is a Washington, D.C. non-profit organization that serves members of Congress, national political leaders, and senior congressional staff by offering experiential pilgrimages, reflection groups, retreats and public forums."  Through its nonpartisan programs, the group "works to bridge racial, religious, and political divisions among elected officials, while promoting reflective and ethical leadership. Since 1991, over 300 members of Congress have taken part in efforts "that encourage collaborative and visionary leadership practices and foster healing, civility, and respect." Joan M. Mooney serves as its President & CEO. Many Democratic and Republican Congressional Representatives work with the organization, including those on its Congressional Advisory Board; however, the late Representative John Lewis, a former leader of the civil rights movement in America, played a special role in its programs, including its annual Civil Rights Pilgrimage to Alabama.
