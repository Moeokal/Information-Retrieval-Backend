The AC NM AE T1 (Mina Anti-Carro Não-Magnética Auto Explosiva modelo T1) is a Brazilian minimum metal anti-tank blast mine. The mine is believed to be in service with the Brazilian army, although production of the mine ceased in 1989. The mine has a square plastic main body, with a raised circular pressure plate and fuze. A carry handle is built into one side of the mine. It appears to be very similar to the PRB M3.
The mine is reportedly used in Ecuador, Peru and Libya.
