Felipa de Souza (1556, Portugal â€“ 1600, Brazil) was a woman who had romantic relationships with other women during the Brazilian colonial era. She was accused of sodomy and because of that she fell victim of the Catholic Inquisition.
Her name was adopted by the OutRight Action International (formerly known as International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission) to name its annual human rights prize.
