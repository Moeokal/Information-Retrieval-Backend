"Fairground" is a song by British soul and pop band Simply Red, released on 18 September 1995 as the first single from their fifth album, Life (1995). Co-written and co-produced by frontman Mick Hucknall, it makes extensive use of a sample of Dutch duo the Goodmen's 1993 hit "Give It Up". It became Simply Red's first and only No. 1 single on the UK Singles Chart, staying at the top for four weeks in September and October 1995, and was also a chart hit in mainland Europe and Australia, but failed to generate long-term success in North America.
