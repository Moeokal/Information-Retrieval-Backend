The First Parish Church is a historic church at 50 Church Street in Waltham, Massachusetts, whose Unitarian Universalist congregation has a history dating to c. 1696.  The current meeting house was built in 1933 after a fire destroyed the previous building (the congregation's third) on the same site.  It is a Classical Revival structure designed by the nationally known Boston firm of Allen & Collens.  The church building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.
