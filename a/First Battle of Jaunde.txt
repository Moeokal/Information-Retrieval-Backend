The First Battle of Jaunde involved the attempted British and French assault on the German capital of Jaunde during the Kamerun Campaign of the First World War. Due to a lack of coordination, difficult terrain, adverse weather conditions, and stiff German resistance, the attack was forced to retreat in late June 1915. Another assault on the capital would not be conducted until later that year.
