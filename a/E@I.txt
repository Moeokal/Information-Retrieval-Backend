E@I ("Education@Internet") is an international youth non-profit organization that hosts educational projects and meetings to support intercultural learning and the usage of languages and internet technologies.
E@I started as an informal international work group in 1999, before it was officially registered in Slovakia in 2005. E@I's activities include the development of educational websites (lernu! and Slovake.eu, among others); publishing, such as books and DVDs; and organizing conferences and seminars, including the biennial KAEST and the Esperanto Wikimania in 2011. A specialist group within the organization is dedicated to Wikipedia.
E@I is a member organization of the Council of Europe's European Youth Foundation and one of the 29 organizations represented in the European Commission's Civil Society Platform for Multlingualism. Projects run by the organization have been subsidized by the Esperantic Studies Foundation and the European Commission's Youth in Action programme and Lifelong Learning Programme (through EACEA). The coordinator of E@I's activities is Peter Baláž, who was elected Esperantist of the Year 2012 in a poll held by the magazine La Ondo de Esperanto.
