Fetal resorption (also known as fetus resorption) is the disintegration and assimilation of one or more fetuses in the uterus at any stage after the completion of organogenesis, which, in humans, is after the ninth week of gestation. Before organogenesis, the process is called embryo loss. Resorption is more likely to happen early on in the gestation than later on; a later death of a fetus is likely to result in a miscarriage.
