Ferris Roy Fain (March 29, 1921 â€“ October 18, 2001) was an American professional baseball player. He played as a first baseman in Major League Baseball from 1947 to 1955. A five-time All-Star, Fain won two American League batting championships and his career on-base percentage of .424 ranks 13th highest in Major League Baseball history.Fain played nine seasons with the Philadelphia Athletics, Chicago White Sox, Detroit Tigers and Cleveland Indians in the American League. Known as one of the Athletics' last stars before moving to Kansas City, he had an explosive temper on and off the field. Eventually it affected his playing ability, and the Athletics traded him after the 1952 season. In his later life, Fain made headlines for his troubles with the law, mainly growing marijuana.
