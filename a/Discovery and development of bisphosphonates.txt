Bisphosphonates are an important class of drugs originally introduced about half a century ago. They are used for the treatment of osteoporosis and other bone disorders that cause bone fragility and diseases where bone resorption is excessive. Osteoporosis is common in post-menopausal women and patients in corticosteroid treatment where biphosphonates have been proven a valuable treatment and also used successfully against Paget's disease, myeloma, bone metastases and hypercalcemia. Bisphosphonates reduce breakdown of bones by inhibiting osteoclasts, they have a long history of use and today there are a few different types of bisphosphonate drugs on the market around the world.
