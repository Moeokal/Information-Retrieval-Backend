The fidola, folk viola or fideola is the size of a viola but shaped like a guitar. It has five strings strung like a standard violin and viola (CGDAE). It was invented in the 1980s by Luthier Alan Carruth of Newport, New Hampshire. It is played with a standard viola bow, often strung with black and white hair for a courser, less classical sound.
