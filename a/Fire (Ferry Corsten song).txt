"Fire" by Ferry Corsten is a trance song that was released as a single in 2005, as well as appearing on Ferry Corsten's 2006 album L.E.F. It features vocals by Simon Le Bon (of the popular 80's band Duran Duran) from the 1990 song "Serious" by Duran Duran, which were re-recorded by Le Bon rather than sampled from the original song. A compilation of eight different remixes, also called "Fire", was released in 2006. The song received wide play throughout Europe through 2006 on commercial radio stations.
