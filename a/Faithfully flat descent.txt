Faithfully flat descent is a technique from algebraic geometry, allowing one to draw conclusions about objects on the target of a faithfully flat morphism. Such morphisms, that are flat and surjective, are common, one example coming from an open cover.
In practice, from an affine point of view, this technique allows one to prove some statement about a ring or scheme after faithfully flat base change.
"Vanilla" faithfully flat descent is generally false; instead, faithfully flat descent is valid under some finiteness conditions (e.g., quasi-compact or locally of finite presentation).
A faithfully flat descent is a special case of Beck's monadicity theorem.
