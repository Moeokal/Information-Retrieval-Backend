Fence is a print and online literary publication containing both original work and critical and journalistic coverage of what may be largely termed "experimental" or "avant garde" material. Conceived by Rebecca Wolff in 1997 and first printed in Spring 1998 (receiving coverage from Poets & Writers), its editors have included Jonathan Lethem and Ben Marcus (fiction), Matthew Rohrer and Caroline Crumpacker (poetry), and Frances Richard (non-fiction).
Fence is published biannually. The translator and National Book Award-nominated poet Cole Swensen edits La Presse, an imprint of Fence magazine publishing contemporary French poetry in translation.
Fence is currently affiliated with the New York State Writers Institute at SUNY Albany.  Its book publishing arm, Fence Books, has printed volumes by a number of younger non-traditional poets. Fence has also joined with McSweeney's, Wave Books and Open City to distribute content at bigsmallpress; it also runs The Constant Critic, an online reviews site.
