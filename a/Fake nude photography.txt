Fake nude photography refers to nude photographs created to appear as actual nudes of an individual. Several reasons for the creation of these doctored photographs include sexual gratification, stigmatization or embarrassment of the subject, or for commercial gain, such as by selling the photographs on pornography websites. Fakes can be created using image editing software or through machine learning (fake pornographic images created this way are referred to as deepfakes).
Many websites host fake nude and pornographic photos of celebrities, which are sometimes referred to as celebrity fakes. Magazines such as Celebrity Skin, which published paparazzi shots and illicitly obtained nude photos, have been cited as precursors to this phenomenon. In the 1990s and 2000s, fake nude images of celebrities proliferated on Usenet and other websites, leading to campaigns to take legal action against the creators of the images and websites dedicated to determining the veracity of nude photos. "Deepfakes", which use artificial neural networks to superimpose a person's face into a pornographic image or video, were popularized in the late 2010s, leading to concerns about the technology's use in fake news and revenge porn.
