A fall line (or fall zone) is the area where an upland region and a coastal plain meet and is typically prominent where rivers cross it, with resulting rapids or waterfalls. The uplands are relatively hard crystalline basement rock, and the coastal plain is softer sedimentary rock. A fall line often will recede upstream as the river cuts out the uphill dense material,  forming "c"-shaped waterfalls and exposing bedrock shoals. Because of these features, riverboats typically cannot travel any farther inland without portaging, unless locks are built.  The rapid change in elevation of the water and resulting energy release make the fall line a good location for water mills, grist mills, and sawmills.  Seeking a head of navigation with a ready supply of water power, people have long made settlements where rivers cross a fall line.
