The Fair Work Act 2009 (the Act) is an Australian law passed by the Rudd Government to reform the industrial relations system in Australia. It replaced the Howard Government's 2005 WorkChoices legislation. The law established Fair Work Australia, later renamed the Fair Work Commission. It is a key piece of legislation, providing for terms and conditions of employment in Australia, and also sets out the rights and responsibilities of parties to that employment.
The Act establishes a safety net consisting of a national set of employment standards, national minimum wage orders, and a compliance and enforcement regime. It also establishes an institutional framework for the administration of the system comprising the Fair Work Commission and the Fair Work Ombudsman, The Fair Work Divisions of the Federal Court and Federal Magistrates Court and, in some cases, state and territory courts, perform the judicial functions under the Act.The Act is the foundation of Australia's industrial relations legal framework, thought to be one of the most complex in the world.
