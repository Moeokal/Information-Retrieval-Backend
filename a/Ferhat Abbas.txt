Ferhat Abbas (Arabic: فرحات عباس‎; ALA-LC: Farḥāt ʿAbbās; 24 August 1899 – 24 December 1985) was an Algerian politician who acted in a provisional capacity as the then yet-to-become independent country's Prime Minister from 1958 to 1961, as well as the first President of the National Assembly and the first acting Chief of State after independence. 
An influential figure in the Young Algerians, Abbas initially advocated for equal political rights for Algerian Muslims in France and for the granting of French citizenship for Algerian Muslims. Over time, he became a revolutionary Algerian nationalist.
