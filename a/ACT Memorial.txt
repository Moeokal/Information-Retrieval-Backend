The ACT Memorial is an Australian war memorial honouring men and women associated with the Australian Capital Territory who served in a number of conflicts and peacekeeping missions throughout the world.  Located in Canberra, on London Circuit, opposite Civic Square, the ACT Memorial consists of two primary components: a physical memorial, and a web site providing public access to a database of names and information about those honoured by the memorial.  The memorial was dedicated on 10 August 2006 by the ACT Chief Minister, Mr Jon Stanhope MLA.
