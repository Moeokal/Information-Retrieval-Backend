Alice Freeman (1857 - 1936) was a Canadian school teacher and investigative journalist.  She became Canada's first female columnist while writing for the Toronto Empire newspaper. Freeman wrote under the pseudonym Faith Fenton to keep her job as a teacher, as journalism was seen as an unacceptably disreputable activity for a teacher to be involved in.  With the low salary she earned at these jobs, she required both salaries to support herself.
