Failos (Garoufail) Kranidiotis (Greek: Φαήλος Κρανιδιώτης) (born 1965) is a Greek far-right politician, lawyer and columnist, chairman of the political party New Right (Nea Dexia).
In March 2016, Kranidiotis, a close associate of former Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, was ousted from conservative New Democracy by leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis over controversial online comments he posted in response to a diplomatic faux pas by Migration Minister Ioannis Mouzalas. Some of his previous comments have also been considered homophobic.
