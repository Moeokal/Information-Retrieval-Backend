Farmers' Almanac TV is a television show that was originally broadcast throughout the USA on public television, based on the periodical of the same name. The magazine-style show covers interesting personalities, unique events and admirable endeavors from both the familiar and remote corners of the North American landscape. Peppered throughout are hints and tips that span a dozen varied lifestyle categories—gardening, cooking, natural cures, weather and others—taken straight from years of actual Almanac pages.  The show is hosted by Jim Wann, the Tony-nominated writer of the musical Pump Boys and Dinettes.The studio Farmers' Almanac TV filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in May 2009. The filing was in Chatham County, Georgia, with documents revealing that the company made no revenue in any of its years of operation.  Over 50 investors have been cut out of any profits as the judge allowed the dissolving company's officers to value the assets at under $150,000, which would go to Turner Investments, an insider who loaned the company money one year earlier.
