The fixed-dose procedure (FDP), proposed in 1992 by the British Toxicology Society, is a method to assess a substance's acute oral toxicity.In comparison to the older LD50 test developed in 1927, this procedure produces similar results while using fewer animals and causing less pain and suffering. As a result, in 1992 this test was proposed as an alternative to the LD50 test by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development under OECD Test Guideline 420. However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has begun to approve non-animal alternatives in response to research cruelty concerns and the lack of validity/sensitivity of animal tests as they relate to humans.
