Fairoaks Airport (ICAO: EGTF) is a general aviation airport between Chobham and Chertsey in Surrey, England. It is 2 NM (3.7 km; 2.3 mi) north of Woking and 2.8 miles (4.5 km) from Junction 11 of the M25 motorway which is between the M3 and A3 junctions.
Fairoaks Aerodrome has a United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority Ordinary Licence that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction as authorised by the licensee. The facility is used by light aircraft, some of which are operated by its two resident training schools - Synergy Aviation
 and London Transport Flying Club, and as a maintenance airfield. Its business centre is substantially dedicated to aviation-related enterprises, including the headquarters of the European Regions Airline Association and the British Helicopter Advisory Board.
Fairoaks was formerly equipped with a non-directional beacon (NDB) for short-range radio navigation, until its withdrawal in January 2020. There is a small on-site fire and rescue service, comprising two 4WD rescue vehicles.
From 1994 until 2009 one of three South East Regional Air Support Unit (Metropolitan and Surrey Police Forces) helicopters (and for a period of this time one for the latter force alone) were at Fairoaks. In June 2009, the remaining police helicopter was transferred to RAF Odiham in Hampshire on security grounds.There are no restrictions on the number of helicopter movements, although there is a ban on training with the Robinson R22. Fixed wing movements are limited to 120,000 per annum.
