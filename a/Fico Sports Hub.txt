Fico Sports Hub was a private 6-hectare recreation centre located at 2 Jurong West St 25, Singapore, then the largest Futsal (5-a-side indoor football) arena in Asia and the first in Asia with water football facilities, which closed its doors to customers on 4 April 2011.[1]
A notable architectural feature of Fico Sports Hub is its white tensile membrane roof, which is designed to keep out the heat and rain over its eight futsal pitches, while embracing an "open" concept, as instead of sidewalls, with nets used to surround the pitches to allow the flow of natural breeze.
The recreation centre was used for water football (football in ankle-deep water), beach volleyball and beach football activities. The beach volleyball and beach football courts use sand that was specially imported for the Swatch FIVB World Tour '2007 tournament in Sentosa and the soccer court was an inflatable water soccer court bought from overseas.
