Lupin III: Farewell to Nostradamus (Japanese: ルパン三世 くたばれ!ノストラダムス, Hepburn: Rupan sansei: Kutabare! Nosutoradamusu, lit. "Lupin III: Die! Nostradamus"), sometimes also referred to as To Hell With Nostradamus, is a 1995 Japanese animated film. It is the fourth theatrical feature film in the Lupin III franchise, and the first time Lupin's voice is provided by Kanichi Kurita, following the death of Yasuo Yamada; a tribute to him appears after the credits in the original Japanese release.  The North American release was done by Funimation; it was released individually and later made a part of the "Final Haul" box set. For reasons unknown Funimation cut the tribute to Yasuo Yamada out of their release.
