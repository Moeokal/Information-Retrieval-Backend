The pair skating competition of the 2018 Winter Olympics was held at the Gangneung Ice Arena in Gangneung, South Korea. The short program was held on 14 February and the free skating on 15 February 2018. Aljona Savchenko and Bruno Massot became Olympic champions after finishing fourth in the short program and setting a record with their score in the free program to take the gold by 0.43 points. Sui Wenjing and Han Cong, leading after the short program, made a couple of mistakes in the free program and won silver. Meagan Duhamel and Eric Radford were third. This was the second Olympics since 1964 that a Soviet or Russian pair did not win a medal.
Chinese judges Chen Weiguang and Huang Feng were investigated by the ISU and banned for mark manipulation.
