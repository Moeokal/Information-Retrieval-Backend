The E.torQ is a family of inline-4 gasoline automobile engines produced since 2011 by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles in Campo Largo, Brazil in the former Tritec factory.The E.torQ series is an update on the Tritec engine, albeit re-engineered by Fiat Powertrain Technologies with an investment of â‚¬83 million. Updates include a high pressure injected aluminum block from the previous iron, and upgraded motors and controllers for the CNC machines used in the manufacturing process to increase productivity and ease diagnosis. The engine block has cylinder head fittings separate from the cylinder jackets, the threads are positioned in the upper part of the water jackets, and the connections between the jackets and the outside are kept apart from the cylinder head fittings. 80% of torque becomes available at 1,500 rpm and 93% at 2,500.
The new family of E.torQ engines is composed of two variants: the 1.6 16v and the 1.8 16v; both engines are available in flexifuel (petrol or ethanol) version for the Brazilian and Paraguayan markets.The series was introduced to replace General Motors' 1.8 Ecotec X18XE engine used in Brazilian Fiat models, as well as the old Torque engine used in various Fiat models.
In March 2018, the series reached a milestone of 1.2 million units produced; 35% of total production was exported to FCA plants in Argentina, Turkey, and Fiat's native Italy.
