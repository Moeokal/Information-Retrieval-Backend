"Family" is the 22nd and the last episode of the first season of the CW television series The Secret Circle, and the series' 22nd and last episode overall. It was aired on May 10, 2012. The episode was written by Andrew Miller & Andrea Newman and it was directed by Dave Barrett.
One day after the final episode was aired, on May 11, 2012, the CW cancelled the series. The ratings decline in the second half of the season, the expensive cost of special effects, and dramatic locations were cited as reasons for the show's cancellation.
