Evangeline is a 1980s comic book co-created and written initially by then-husband and wife team Chuck Dixon and Judith Hunt, with pencils by Hunt and inks by Ricardo Villagran. Letters were by cartoonist and letterer Ed King of the Star Wars comic strip.
The art for the first few issues of Evangeline was unusual for the time period, in that it was not printed using process color, but instead each page was hand-painted by Hunt and then color separated. This method was introduced by the newly formed independent comic companies and was encouraged by the cheaper printing methods of the 1980s. Cover paintings were also illustrated by Hunt and Villagran.
The title character has been described as "a sexy killer vigilante nun" taking her instructions directly from her mentor, Cardinal Szn, a politically powerful figure in the hierarchy of the Roman Curia/Vatican during the 23rd-century. However, co-creator Hunt would describe her skilled but naive  feminist character as created "to explore the infinite conflict between good and evil and the powerful religions which would be involved in manipulating the politics and economics of the future".
