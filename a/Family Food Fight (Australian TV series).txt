Family Food Fight (abbreviated as FFF) was an Australian reality competition television series that aired on the Nine Network from 30 October 2017 until 11 December 2018. The series saw diverse and multi-generational Australian families go head-to-head in high-pressure cooking challenges inspired by real home cooking and family food traditions to win an ultimate prize of $100,000.Although the first season of the series had disappointing ratings, a desire to sell the show internationally led it to be renewed for a second season, which premiered on 29 October 2018. Despite a number of international adaptations, the show continued to struggle to find an audience locally and no further seasons have been commissioned.
