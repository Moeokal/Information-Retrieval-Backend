The Federation Against Software Theft (FAST) is a not-for-profit organisation, formed in 1984 with the aim of eliminating copyright infringement of software in the UK. FAST was the world's first Anti-piracy organisation to work on protecting the copyrights of software publishers. Initially concentrating on lobbying parliament to revise Copyright law, FAST also prosecutes organisations and individuals for copyright infringement on behalf of its members and publicises the legal penalties and security risks.
Prior to the agreement with FAST, Investors in Software were a not-for-profit organisation limited by guarantee with a mission to support and advance professionalism in Software Asset Management and related IT asset management, to enable individuals and organisations to improve effectiveness and efficiency. As a direct result of their work the ISO SAM ISO 19770 standard was successfully launched in May 2006.
