Fijiâ€“India relations refer to foreign relations between Fiji and India. Fiji has a high commission in New Delhi, whilst India has a high commission in Suva.
There are strong cultural links between the countries as 38 percent of Fiji's population is of Indian descent.  India has used its influence in international forums such as the Commonwealth of Nations and United Nations on behalf of ethnic Indians in Fiji, lobbying for sanctions against Fiji in the wake of the 1987 coups and the  2000 coup, both of which removed the incumbent governments. In the first case the government was dominated by Indo-Fijians while in the second case it was led by Indo-Fijians.
