Today, the 100 most populous cities are ranked annually.  As of 2021, Arlington, VA was ranked as the fittest city in America; Oklahoma City, OK ranked as the least fit city, both for the fourth year in a row.The Fitness Index's goal is to provide local policy-makers with the information necessary to improve the health, fitness, and quality of life of community residents by promoting healthier lifestyles and physical activity.
