The F136, commonly known as Ferrari-Maserati engine, is a family of 90° V8 petrol engines jointly developed by Ferrari and Maserati and produced by Ferrari; these engines displace between 4.2 L and 4.7 L, and produce between 390 PS (287 kW; 385 hp) and 605 PS (445 kW; 597 hp). All engines are naturally aspirated, incorporate dual overhead camshafts, variable valve timing, and four valves per cylinder.
The architecture was produced in various configurations for Ferrari and Maserati automobiles, and the Alfa Romeo 8C. Production started in 2001.  Ferrari was spun-off from their common parent company in January 2016 and has stated they will not renew the contract to supply engines to Maserati by 2022.Starting with the 2013 Maserati Quattroporte GTS, and following with the 2014 Ferrari California T, the F136 was replaced by the twin turbocharged Ferrari F154 V8 engine.
In recent years this engine has been chosen as a swap for iconic project cars such as GT4586 ( Ryan Tuerck)[1] and TRUERRARI ( Fernando Montero ) [2]. Many lower budget projects are using the Maserati variations for engine swaps, as well, such as Twitch_masterflex’s F136S swapped Scion FRS.
