Feels Like Today is the third studio album by American country music group Rascal Flatts. It was released in September 28, 2004 via Lyric Street Records The album has sold 5.274 million copies in the United States as of July 2014, and it has been certified 5Ã— Multi-Platinum by the RIAA. The album produced its title track as a single along with "Bless the Broken Road", "Fast Cars and Freedom", and "Skin (Sarabeth)". "Bless the Broken Road" was initially recorded by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, and has also been recorded by Marcus Hummon, Melodie Crittenden (whose version was a number 42 country single in 1997), and Geoff Moore before the release of Rascal Flatts' version. It would later be a Top 5 Christian hit for Selah as well. "When the Sand Runs Out" was later recorded by Marty Raybon on his 2006 album of the same name.
"Skin (Sarabeth)", initially a hidden track, received enough airplay to enter Top 40 on the country charts in 2005, leading to its release as a single after "Fast Cars and Freedom". Upon its release to radio, "Skin (Sarabeth)" was officially added to the track list. "Here's to You" also charted from unsolicited airplay, and was made into a music video.
This was the band's last album to be produced by Mark Bright.
