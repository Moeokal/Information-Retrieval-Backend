Fei Ye (Chinese: 菲野; born 1962) is a Chinese poet who was also involved in the Chinese democracy movement. Although often associated with the Misty Poets, he considers himself of a younger generation and dismisses the label. Fei has published four underground books of poetry and translated two books of Russian poetry, including the work of Osip Mandelstam. He lives in the United States after being exiled from China.
