Fashion Island is a shopping mall located on Ramintra Road, in Khan Na Yao District outskirt of Bangkok, Thailand.
Fashion Island is currently ranked as the Twenty-sixth largest mall in the World along with Dubai Mall and West Edmonton Mall (once biggest mall in the world until 2004).
The shopping mall featured an amusement park with a monorail circling around the mall. It was 1.4 km (0.87 mi) in length with four stations. The amusement park and monorail were both shut down after an accident. On 26 June 2002, a short circuit caused one train to catch fire.  The train had no circuit breaker, and the passenger compartment was not protected by fireproof insulation.  Two girls, six and eight years old, died in the fire, and two more children were injured from jumping out of the train.
