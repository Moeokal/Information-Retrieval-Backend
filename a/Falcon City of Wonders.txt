Falcon City of Wonders (FCW) is a Dubai-based real-estate project working as a subsidiary of Salem Ahmad AlMoosa Enterprises founded in 2005. The project will include international-themed villas, spacious apartments, shopping malls, hotels, business offices, fine-dining restaurants, health clubs, spas, nurseries, schools and parks. When viewed from above, the development will resemble a falcon, with the Falcon Mall forming the head of the falcon. As of 2022, the project has only completed the Left Wing of the city, with major portions still on hold.
