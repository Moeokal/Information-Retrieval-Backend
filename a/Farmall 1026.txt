The Farmall 1026 is a row crop tractor with a hydraulic drive system, or hydro, produced by International Harvester from 1970â€“1971.  Rated at 112 power take off, (PTO) horsepower, the Farmall 1026 was the first 100+ horsepower hydro tractor ever produced.
The 1026 was produced as a hydro only model.  This was unique to this model, as the other hydro models produced by International Harvester at the time were also built as gear drive versions in addition to the hydro versions, while still maintaining the same model number. The Farmall 656 and 826, for example, were available in hydro and gear drive versions.
