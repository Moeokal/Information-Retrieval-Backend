Familial renal amyloidosis is a form of amyloidosis primarily presenting in the kidney.It is associated most commonly with congenital mutations in the fibrinogen alpha chain and classified as a dysfibrinogenemia (see Hereditary Fibrinogen AÎ±-Chain Amyloidosis). and, less commonly, with congenital mutations in apolipoprotein A1 and lysozyme.It is also known as "Ostertag" type, after B. Ostertag, who characterized it in 1932 and 1950.
