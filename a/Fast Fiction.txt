Fast Fiction was a market stall, magazine, mail order distributor and news sheet that played a key role in the history of British small press comics. It existed in its various forms from 1981 through to 1990 under the stewardship of Paul Gravett, Phil Elliott and Ed Pinsent.
The name was taken from a Classics Illustrated knock-off spotted in the Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide.
