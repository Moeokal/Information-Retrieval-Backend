The Finger Lakes AVA is an American Viticultural Area located in Upstate New York, south of Lake Ontario.  The Finger Lakes encompass eleven glacial lakes, but the area around Canandaigua, Keuka, Seneca, and Cayuga Lakes contain the vast majority of vineyard plantings in the AVA. Cayuga and Seneca Lakes each have their own American Viticultural Areas completely contained within the Finger Lakes AVA (Cayuga Lake AVA and Seneca Lake AVA).  The Finger Lakes AVA includes 11,000 acres (4,452 ha) of vineyards and is the largest wine-producing region in New York State. As of 2020 the Spotted Lanternfly has been discovered in New York. Its possible damage could devastate the Finger Lake wine industry.
