Under United States federal income tax law, filing status determines which tax return form an individual will use and is an important factor in computing taxable income. Filing status is based on marital status and family situation.There are five possible filing status categories: single individual, married person filing jointly or surviving spouse, married person filing separately, head of household and a qualifying widow(er) with dependent children. A taxpayer who qualifies for more than one filing status may choose the most advantageous status.
