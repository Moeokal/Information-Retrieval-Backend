Fenenna of Kuyavia (also known as of Inowrocław; Polish: Fenenna kujawska or inowrocławska; c. 1276–1295) was a Queen of Hungary by marriage to King Andrew III.
Fenenna was the daughter of Duke Ziemomysł of Inowrocław by his wife Salomea, daughter of Duke Sambor II of Pomerania.Fenenna's existence is corroborated by only two sources: the Genealogia sanctae Hedwigis (Genealogy of Saint Hedwig) and the Chronicles of Jan Długosz, as well in the Hungarian sources. The Genealogy states that an unnamed daughter of Duke Ziemomysł was betrothed to the King of Hungary. Based on this information, Jan Długosz stated that Fenenna married King Stephen V. This erroneous information was maintained by the later historiography until the 19th century, when Fenenna was correctly described as the wife of King Andrew III.
Although Fenenna did not play a significant role in the Hungarian court, her marriage did strengthen the alliance between her husband and her uncle Władysław I the Elbow-high, and it also benefited her Kuyavia relatives' relations with, among others, King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia. Shortly after Andrew III's death, their daughter Elizabeth was betrothed to the future Wenceslaus III, who claimed the Hungarian crown.
