Fair river sharing is a kind of a fair division problem in which the waters of a river has to be divided among  countries located along the river. It differs from other fair division problems in that the resource to be divided - the water - flows in one direction - from upstream countries to downstream countries. To attain any desired division, it may be required to limit the consumption of upstream countries, but this may require to give these countries some monetary compensation.
In addition to sharing river water, which are an economic good, it is often required to share river pollution (or the cost of cleaning it), which is an economic bad.
