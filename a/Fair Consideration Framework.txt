Fair Consideration Framework (FCF) is a guideline announced by Singapore's Ministry of Manpower that requires employers to consider Singaporeans fairly for all job opportunities before hiring Employment Pass (EP) holders. The FCF was announced on 23 September 2013 and was a result from the feedback received through MOM's "Our Singapore Conversation" sessions, employer groups and key stakeholders such as the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC).
