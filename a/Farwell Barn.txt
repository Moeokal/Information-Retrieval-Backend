The Farwell Barn, also known as Jacobson Barn or Jacobson's Barn, is a historic property on Horsebarn Hill Road in Storrs, Connecticut, on the campus of the University of Connecticut.  The property is also the site of the archaeological remains of the Farwell House.  The barn "is a 19th-century post-and-beam framed clapboarded barn that was built as part of a family farm and then in 1911 was acquired by the Connecticut Agricultural College, the institution that became the University of Connecticut at Storrs."  The corresponding house was burned in 1976.  The barn was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.
