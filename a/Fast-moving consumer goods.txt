Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), also known as consumer packaged goods (CPG), are products that are sold quickly and at a relatively low cost. Examples include non-durable household goods such as packaged foods, beverages, toiletries, candies, cosmetics, over-the-counter drugs, dry goods, and other consumables.Fast moving consumer goods have a high inventory turnover and are contrasted with specialty items which have lower sales and higher carrying charges.  Many retailers carry only FMCGs; particularly hypermarkets, big box stores and warehouse club stores.  Small convenience stores also stock fast moving goods; the limited shelf space is filled with higher turnover items.
