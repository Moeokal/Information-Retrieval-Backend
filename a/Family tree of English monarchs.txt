This is the family tree for monarchs of England (and Wales after 1282) from Alfred the Great to Elizabeth I of England. The House of Wessex family tree precedes this family tree and the family tree of the British royal family follows it.
As to the medieval histories of Scotland and Wales:

The family tree of Scottish monarchs covers the same period in Scotland and, equally as shown, directly precedes the family tree of the British royal family.
The family tree of Welsh monarchs is relevant before the 1282 conquest by England.For a simplified family tree see family tree of British monarchs (and alternative successions of the English and British crown for unsuccessful claimants' family trees).
