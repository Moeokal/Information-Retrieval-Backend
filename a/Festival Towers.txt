Festival Towers is a skyscraper of apartment buildings located in Brisbane, Australia. It is situated on the corner of Albert and Charlotte Streets. The tower boasts a modern green facade with a vivid architectural stance.
Festival Tower consists of 41 floors of 401 apartments ranging from one to three bedrooms. The tower also contains a podium level for residents and guests equipped with a pool, a spa, lawn and a dining area. The cost of construction was $162 million.The tower stands on the site where Brisbane Festival Hall once stood, and the many images in the foyer pay homage to artists who played there.
In 2007, under the managements of the Oaks Group, the majority of rental leases were converted to short-term accommodation stays, effectively forcing out hundreds of residents and converting the building into a hotel. Subsequently, the building became a mix of owner-occupiers, corporate guests and permanent rentals.
