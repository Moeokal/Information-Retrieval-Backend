The figure skating events in 1998 Winter Olympics were held at the White Ring in Nagano. There were no changes in the format or scoring systems from 1994. Professionals were again allowed to compete, although they had to declare that intention and compete in ISU-approved events to do so. Most of the top competitors by 1998 were now openly professional.
The competitions took place on the following days:

Pairs: 8–10 February 1998
Men's singles: 12–14 February 1998
Ice dance: 13–16 February 1998
Ladies' singles: 18–20 February 1998
Exhibition gala: 21 February 1998
