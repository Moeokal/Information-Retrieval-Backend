The Hungarian Feminist Association  (Hungarian: Feministák Egyesülete (FE), 1904–1942) was created by Rosika Schwimmer and Vilma Glücklich. The organization pushed for women's equality in Hungary in all spheres of women's life. In addition to pressing for women's suffrage, they drafted replies to modification of the marriage statutes and urged government response to address employment and training for women workers.
