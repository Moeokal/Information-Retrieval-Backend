Ferry flying is the flying of aircraft for the purpose of returning to base, delivery to a customer, moving from one base of operations to another or moving to or from a maintenance facility for maintenance, repair, and operations.A commercial airliner may need to be moved from one airport to another at the end of that day's operations to satisfy the next day's timetable or to facilitate routine scheduled maintenance; this is commonly known as a positioning flight or repositioning flight, and may sometimes carry revenue freight or passengers as local aviation regulations and airline policies allow. They may also be necessary following a major weather event or other similar disruption which causes multiple cancellations across an airline's network resulting in many aircraft and crew being 'out of position' for normal operations; the 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallaj√∂kull or the mass evacuation of US airspace following the 9/11 attacks being significant examples of this.
