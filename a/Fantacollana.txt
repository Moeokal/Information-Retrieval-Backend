Fantacollana was a series of fantasy books published in Italy by Editrice Nord. The first number, issued in May 1973, featured The Jewels of Aptor by Samuel R. Delany. The first issues, edited by Riccardo Valla, featured covers by artists such as Karel Thole, Michael Whelan and Frank Frazetta. Valla was replaced in the mid-1970s by Sandro Pergameno, who was followed by Alex Voglino.
Authors translated included US fantasy writers such as L. Sprague de Camp, Fritz Leiber, Robert E. Howard, Jack Vance, C. J. Cherryh, Marion Zimmer Bradley, David Gemmell, Harry Turtledove, Stephen R. Lawhead,  and others. Original books from Italian authors were also published.
The series reduced substantially frequency of publication in the 2000s, including mostly short story collections edited by Marion Zimmer Bradley, and in 2006 and 2007 only two issues were published per year. The last issue was a translation of Marion Zimmer Bradley's Four Moons of Darkover, published in November 2008.
