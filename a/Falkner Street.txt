Falkner Street is a street mostly in Canning, with a short section in  Edge Hill, Liverpool, England. The street, built during the early-mid 19th century, is named after Edward Falkner, who had previously commissioned the construction Falkner Square. Constructed at a time when Liverpool had less than 100,000 houses, the Falkner Street houses sold for around £1,000 (equivalent to £101923 in 2019) and were affordable to only the wealthiest 1% of the population.
