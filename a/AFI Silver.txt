AFI Silver Theatre and Cultural Center or commonly known as AFI Silver  is a three-screen movie theater complex in downtown Silver Spring, Maryland, north of Washington, D.C. Its main auditorium hosts the DC Metro area's third-largest commercial movie theater screen, and the second-largest commercial movie theater screen outside of the Smithsonian Institution (after the Uptown Theater in Cleveland Park). Run by the American Film Institute, it plays modern art-house and independent works alongside classic films. 
The AFI Silver is the result of a restoration project for the original Silver Theatre in Silver Spring, designed by movie palace architect John Eberson and constructed in 1938.
