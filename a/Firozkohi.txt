The Firozkohi (Dari: فیروزکوهی) are a sub-tribe of the Chahar Aimaq ethnic group in Afghanistan, one of the four major Aimaq tribes, which also include the Jamshidi, Taymani, and Taimuri. In 1987, the Firozkohi were the second-largest Aymaq tribe, after the Taymani. The Hazaras of Qala-i Nau are also included in the Aimaq confederacy. The Firozkohi speak the Aimaq dialect of Dari Persian and claim Pashtun descent. They are named after Firozkoh, the medieval capital of the Ghurid dynasty.
The Firozkohi are semi-nomadic and inhabit the valleys of the Murghab River, largely in Badghis Province.
