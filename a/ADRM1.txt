Proteasomal ubiquitin receptor ADRM1 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the ADRM1 gene. Recent evidences on proteasome complex structure confirmed that the protein encoded by gene ADRM1, also known in yeast as 26S Proteasome regulatory subunit Rpn13 (systematic nomenclature for proteasome subunits), is a subunit of 19S proteasome complex.
