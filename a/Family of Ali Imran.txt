Ali Imran is a fictional spymaster and the protagonist of the Imran Series of Urdu spy novels by the Pakistani author Ibn-e-Safi.
Ali Imran enjoys living around a complete family: a father, mother, and a sister. Several of Imran's female cousins, often found making fun of him, lives with his family.
Imran's dearly attachment with his family is evident in some of the books. For example, In the "Allama Dehshatnak" serial, he finds the only way to anger the villain is by getting personal with him and mocking his history and the fact that his family was very brutally destroyed. By doing so however, Imran provokes the villain to counter by bombing his family's house. At this point the reader sees how deeply Imran loves his family as he rushes to the scene throwing all the caution out of the window.
Imran's parents, it is also often told, are Yusufzai Pashtuns and direct descendant of Genghis Khan.
