Fever High took shape in the summer of 2013 at the studio of the band’s producer/member, Adam Schlesinger (Fountains of Wayne). “Leah and I would come over to Adam’s studio and sing on demo tracks he would be writing for various things. We would joke about the three of us starting a band,” Nordeen told Bedford + Bowery. “Next thing I know, we’re thinking up band names. Adam wrote a few songs to get us started and now we all collaborate.”
