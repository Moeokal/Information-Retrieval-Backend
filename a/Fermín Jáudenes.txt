Fermín Jáudenes y Álvarez (July 7, 1836 – February 11, 1915) was briefly a Governor-General of the Philippines, from July 24 to August 13, 1898, under the Spanish Empire during the Spanish–American War and the second phase of the Philippine Revolution.
During his term, Spanish turned over the Philippines capital, Manila, to the United States Army in the "mock" Battle of Manila and in the process the Spanish surrendered to America, ending over 330 years of rule of Spanish colonial rule.
Jáudenes was in Manila when the Spanish parliament, the Cortes, learned of Governor-General Basilio Augustín's attempt to negotiate the surrender of the army to Filipinos under Emilio Aguinaldo. This caused Augustin's removal on July 24, 1898, and the appointment of Jáudenes.
